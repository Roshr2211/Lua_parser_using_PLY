# Lua Parser with PLY

Hello!!!
This project implements a Lua parser using PLY (Python Lex-Yacc). The parser is capable of handling various Lua language constructs, including:

- Variable Declaration
- If Statements
- While Loops
- For Loops
- Function Declaration


## About

This project provides a Lua parser written in Python using PLY. It aims to parse and analyze Lua code snippets with a focus on handling constructs such as variable declarations, if statements, while loops, for loops, and function declarations.

## Features

- **Variable Declaration:** Parse and handle Lua variable declarations.

- **If Statements:** Recognize and interpret Lua if statements.

- **While Loops:** Implement parsing for Lua while loops.

- **For Loops:** Parse and handle Lua for loops.

- **Function Declaration:** Parse and handle Lua function declarations.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. Additionally, install the PLY library:

```bash
pip install ply
